            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>For the hackathon, I needed something that would be easy and quick to make, and that was already fun, as I didn't have the time
                to come up with an original idea and make prototypes to test if it's fun. However, the game also had to be complex enough to 
                allow for other ideas to come in as well. That is why I chose the game Pong, as I already had a unique spin(pun intended) in mind 
                for the game. The basic idea was to add the ability to rotate the paddles while playing.

                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>First step was to make the design in Unity and set up all of the sprites to be able to collide by giving each sprite a 2DCollider
                        and a Rigidbody 2D, as well as make the ball bouncy with the bouncy material so that it bounces off walls.

                    <p>The logic manager is a separate sprite that cannot be interacted with, and controls the score, keeping track of who won, 
                        updating the UI, and restarting the scene.

                    <p>
                        Since I had a little bit of time left, I decided to give the player a new ability, which is to be able to spin faster 
                        at the cost of movement. This was in the Player movement script, and as you can see, it requires the shift key nearest to 
                        each player to be held down. In addition, I also added a Pause Menu and a Main Menu so that it looks more polished, and I also 
                        messed around with the new Unity Text, TextMeshPro.
